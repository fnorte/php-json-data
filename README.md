## ISSUES

### 2023-10

- Updated but I have no idea where, I just took the most recent code I used and pasted it here, as it was already too old and loose to spend on proofreading.

- Avoid any reference to read directly to the file in Parent classes.

- Find way to protect the direct access to the file

- protect problems with read and write to the file
